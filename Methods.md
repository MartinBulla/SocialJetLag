METHODS

AVIARIES
- logged temperature
	- seewater in the aviary
	- air temperature in the aviary
	- 6, 7 water in the tank
- T of seewater going to the aviary set to 17C with 0.2 offset
- outside air system is off and closed in all aviaries
- birds checked daily through the glass
- cleaning
	- every week sweep/scrape the floors
	- bleach - we will see (single aviaries maybe never, group aviary once)

ACC	
- AXY-3: 60mA battery
- AXY-4: 60mA battery, size 13.7 x 23.5 x 10.5mm (width, length, height)
- deployement procedure
 1) set the Acc: 25hz, 4g, 10bit, T enabled 
 2) glue rasin Acc or one in heat shrink tube to the leather (xx mm think) with Pattex super glue
 3) start Acc before going to the aviaries - blinks quickly then does interrupted blink and then starts 30s blinking, here press DeDeDe in the database
 4) cut the leather to desired shape and glue it with Pattex super glue to birds rump (trimped of feather).
 5) note the time when you release the bird into the aviary.

# bird sample
	11 isla spare birds 
	3 can spare birds 
	2 ruf spare birds 
	12 isl randomly sampled from 62
# WEEK SAMPLING 
	- isl random sample (1 week 3, then 4), first bird in aviary 4, secon 5 and so on, aviary 7 does not go to group part of exp
	- ruf - 1 week
	- can - last week
	- random sample generated trios with varying sex (except for one group) and varying age (except for two groups)
	
	
OLD:

AXY-3
 - We could prepare them rather soon, in 2-3 weeks (unless you need the URGENTLY!)
- Memory yes, battery depends on the size. 40 days you need at least a 60mAh battery.
- 10 devices are 3900EUR in total, plus 50 EUR for shipping.
|battery mAh| bat(days) | weight|
|-----------|-----------|-------|
|40			| 25-30     |1.5g|
|60			| 40        |1.9g|
|95			|           |2.5g|

memory 
30 days/ 25hz
80 days/ 10hz

- 40, 60 and 95mAh batteries. The weights are around 1.5, 1.9, 2.5g total weight, Axy+battery
- heatshrink tube

 40mAh battery would last around 25-30 days, the 60mah battery around 40 days. The memory is enough to record 30 days at 25hz, or 80 days at 10 hz
 
New loggers:
 
axy4

Hi Martin
a) Do they have internal number?
No, but you can give them a name or number with the software.

> b) Before deployment, you suggest to start the logger, and then use the heat shrink tube to make them waterproof.
Exactly. But you can also first make them waterproof and then start them, since the heat shrink tube is transparent and you can see the led blinking.

>  - Is there any possibility to avoid the damage, we have experienced with the previous loggers, while having the option to download the data?
Well, the heat shrink is very practical because you can cut and open it in seconds, in order to download the data.
In case we can put epoxy around the new loggers and they will be completely waterproof, without issues as last year. For those of last year this is however not possible. In any case heat shrink is much better, in my opinion.

You need to enter the time when started. When you disconnect the logger from the computer the logger will be automatically OFF, so you need to switch it on with the magnet again.
So you cannot download the data and let the logger run. It is better to turn it off with the software, and start it again.

Tomorrow morning is not possible, unfortunatley. Today, or tomorrow afternoon, or the day after tomorrow all day.

Axy4 with 40mA lithium batteries, yes. They should last, ideally, for 3 weeks (25hz).
Setting 
1) set it in computer
2) magnet, disconnect ( it is off)
3) start with magnet (not the time when it starts blinking for 29s (after consequtive blinking): the software knows that the recording starts 30s later (if started at 00:00:00 it will have first reading at 00:00:30)

Heat shring tube (battery cannot be exposed to heat of more than 70C):
a) wrap the logger into food plastic
b) use cigaret lighter
c) lihtly on the battery side then on the other side and leave 3mm space between the logger and the end of the sealed tube
d) when opening - cut on a logger side and between logger side + battery (be carefull not the cut the wires).
